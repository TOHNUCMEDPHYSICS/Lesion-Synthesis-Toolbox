# Lesion-Synthesis-Toolbox
A MATLAB GUI based application with a suite of PET simulation and image reconstruction tools. Designed to work seamlessly with GE Discovery 600/690/710 PET/CT systems, this toolbox has 3 main products. (1) DiscoveryDR an over the network data retrieval tool to extract raw PET and CT data from a Discovery 600/690/710 PET/CT System. DiscoveryIR applies clinically available GE PET image reconstruction algorithms on real clinical data (obtained using DiscoveryDR). vDiscovery is an analytical time-of-flight PET simulation package used to generate projection planes of simulated objects considering attenuation and other scanner effects.  vDiscovery is used to simulate lesions in real clinical data, and simulate numerical phantom studies to generate raw projection planes for image reconstruction.
